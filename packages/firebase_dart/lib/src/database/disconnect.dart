/// The Disconnect class encapsulates all operations to be performed on a
/// Firebase when the client is disconnected. This allows you to write or
/// clear data when your client disconnects from the Firebase servers. These
/// updates occur whether your client disconnects cleanly or not, so you can
/// rely on them to clean up data even if a connection is dropped or a client
/// crashes.
///
/// Note that these functions should be called before any data is written to
/// avoid problems if a connection is dropped before the requests can be
/// transferred to the Firebase servers.
///
/// Note that onDisconnect operations are only triggered once. If you want an
/// operation to occur each time a disconnect occurs, you'll need to
/// re-establish the operations each time.
